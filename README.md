# timeout
**What it does**

Time Out allows individuals who are experiencing conflict to pause and recollect for a short 5 minutes. During these 5 minutes, both individuals would have the time to write out their feeling and their desired outcome of the conflict. No interactions are allowed during these 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes are over, the notes that were written by each of the individuals will be shared and both can resume normal communication. If the conflict is still not resolved, both individuals can choose to have an additional 10 minutes of time out. They will have the same opportunity to continue with their notes and it will be shared after the additional time-out period is over.

**How we built it**

React Native libraries, Android Studio, Nodejs, and MongoDB.
